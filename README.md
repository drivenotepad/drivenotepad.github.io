#### Drive Notepad is not affiliated with Google.
It is made by **DM** in his spare time. 
The app is hosted [free on github](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/), 
and Google API requests are also [fulfilled for free](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10313416/2399799).  

This means it costs **nothing** to keep the app up and running, 
and hence it can be provided to users for free. Yay!
***
#### News *Mar 2016*. 
The app is undergoing its biennial refresh, 
but the current development version is already live [here](http://drivenotepad.github.io/app)
